# 🧵 Threads Clone - Flutter & Supabase

A modern, feature-rich clone of the "Threads" app built using **Flutter** and **Supabase**. This project demonstrates how to build a real-time social media platform using Flutter for the front end and Supabase as the backend.

## ✨ Features

- **User Authentication**: Sign up, log in, and manage user sessions using Supabase's built-in authentication (email/password, OAuth providers).
- **Real-Time Threads**: Create, update, and delete threads with real-time updates using Supabase.
- **User Profiles**: Manage user profiles, including profile pictures, bios, and activity history.
- **Interactive UI**: Engage with threads by liking, commenting, and sharing.
- **Media Uploads**: Upload and display images and videos within threads.
- **Notifications**: Real-time notifications for interactions like likes, comments, and mentions.
- **Responsive Design**: A smooth and responsive UI that works across mobile and web platforms.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) - A UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
- **Backend**: [Supabase](https://supabase.io) - An open-source Firebase alternative providing real-time databases, authentication, and storage.
